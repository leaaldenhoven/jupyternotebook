Welcome to this folder!

Please open the preprocessing_guide.ipynb file to see the report.
Usually, this report is interactive, making it possible for the reader to test pieces of code, however the data files used to do this were too large to upload to github.
However, the visuals are all still present, so enjoy the notebook.
